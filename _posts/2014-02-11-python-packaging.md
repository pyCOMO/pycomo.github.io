tags: [pip, virtual environments, distutils, setuptools, distlib, the future]
---

This month's first presentations will cover pip, virtualenv, and virtualenvwrapper.

We'll discuss how to use them, why they're handy, and what a dark and gloomy place the world would be without them.

The second presentation will review the current state of Python packaging; the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

We'll wrap up by taking a peek at the future of Python packaging.
