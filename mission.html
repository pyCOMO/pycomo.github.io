    <h1 class="page-title">PyCOMO's Mission</h1>

    <h3>To connect with other people who enjoy working with Python, and<br />
        to challenge each other to learn more about the language.</h3>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>To fulfill those goals we organize monthly meetings and setup various <br />
        channels of communication so we can connect with other developers.</p>

    <p>Our meetings have presentations that challenge us to explore new ideas <br />
        and learn more about Python.</p>
